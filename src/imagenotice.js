/**
 * The notice for a container that runs from the old image name.
 *
 * The project was renamed to HaspelSync and its image moved with it. GHCR
 * does not redirect an image name, so the old one is published as well for a
 * transition period, and an installation that still pulls it keeps updating
 * without noticing anything. This notice is what makes it notice: the old
 * name will stop receiving releases, and the switch is one line in a compose
 * file. An image cannot see the tag it was pulled by, so the name is baked
 * into each published image by its Dockerfile, see HASPELSYNC_IMAGE.
 *
 * Unlike the other notices, closing this one holds only until the next start
 * of the service: a restart and every new version show the dialog again for
 * as long as the container runs from the old name. The notice is not a one
 * time hint about something that already happened, it asks for a change that
 * has not been made yet, and a dialog dismissed once and forever is never
 * acted on. The log lines and the line under System on the settings page say
 * it regardless.
 *
 * This module must not import logger.js, for the reason settings.js gives.
