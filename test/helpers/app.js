/**
 * Starts the HTTP API against a throwaway data directory.
 *
 * The routes are registered on a bare Express app rather than through
 * `backend.js`, so nothing waits for Spoolman and no monitor loop is started.
 * DATA_DIR and LOG_DIR are pointed at a temporary directory before the modules
 * are imported, which is what keeps the write paths, printers.json,
 * settings.json and the log files, away from a real installation. They are read
 * once at import time, so this has to run before the first import and each test
 * file gets its own process anyway.
 *
 * @param {object} [options]
 * @param {Array} [options.seedPrinters] - Written to printers.json before the import.
 * @returns {Promise<{url: string, dataDir: string, close: function(): Promise<void>, readJson: function(string): object|null}>}
