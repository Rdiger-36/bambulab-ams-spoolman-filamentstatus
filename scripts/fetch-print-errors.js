/**
 * Regenerates src/data/print-errors.json from Bambu Lab's error catalogue.
 *
 * The printer reports a print error as a number, `print_error` and
 * `fail_reason` in the MQTT report, and the catalogue that turns that number
 * into a sentence is served by Bambu Lab's own error lookup, the one Bambu
 * Studio and the Bambu Handy app query:
 *
 *   https://e.bambulab.com/query.php?lang=en&d=<serial prefix>
 *
 * The answer depends on the printer model, which the service picks by the
 * first three characters of a serial number, so the catalogue is fetched once
 * per known prefix and merged. Of the 964 codes with a sentence, 48 differed
 * in wording between models, mostly a mention of the AMS HT or of a second
 * nozzle; the wording most models share is what is kept, so the file stays
 * one sentence per code. Nine codes come without a sentence and are left out.
 *
 * Only `device_error` is kept, which is what the two fields above carry. The
 * catalogue also serves `device_hms`, the HMS notifications in `print.hms`,
 * three times as many codes and three times the bytes for a field this
 * service does not read.
 *
 * English only. The Web UI is English, and every language multiplies the
 * file.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/fetch-print-errors.js
 *
 * The output is sorted and stable, so a rerun that changes nothing produces
 * no diff and a rerun that does shows exactly which sentences moved. ha-bambulab
 * keeps the same catalogue current through its scripts/update_error_text.py,
 * which is where the endpoint and the prefixes were learnt from.
 *
 * This file runs outside the service, so `src/logger.js` and its three
 * argument console signature are not in play here. The plain console is
 * correct.
